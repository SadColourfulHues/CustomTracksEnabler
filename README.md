# Custom Tracks Enabler

This addon adds an 'Enable Custom Tracks' 
context menu command to GLTF files in Godot's file explorer.

Godot 3 used to have a 'Keep Custom Tracks' option in its
import settings, but has somehow been lost to the void during the
transition to 4.0.

Since a lot of my personal projects make great use of custom tracks,
this is a helper script to make the import process a bit more
smoother.

**(Currently tested on Godot 4.4)**

# How to Use

Export animations to a folder using the importer, reimport, then
click on the 'Enable Custom Tracks' button.
