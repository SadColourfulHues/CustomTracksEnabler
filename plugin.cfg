description="Adds a context menu command to Godot File Explorer to make enabling custom tracks for GLTF files easier.\n\n(Note: ensure that all animation tracks have been exported to a directory before running the 'Enable Custom Tracks' command.)\n\n(This is a temporary solution until Godot re-adds the 'Keep Custom Tracks' import option from Godot 3.)"
